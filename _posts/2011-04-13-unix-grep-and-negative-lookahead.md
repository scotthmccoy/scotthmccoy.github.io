"Look through all files in the current directory tree and show me all lines that have <span style="font-weight:bold;">FileName</span>, but are NOT followed eventually by <span style="font-weight:bold;">slide</span>."<br /><br /><pre>grep -r -P 'FileName(?!.+slide)' .</pre><br /><br />The important thing here is the upper-case P! It means "do this using PERL regular expressions". PERL's syntax for negative lookahead is the more common one. Also, make sure to put your PATTERN into single-quotes.
