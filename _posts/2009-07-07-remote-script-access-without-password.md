On the machine you are logging in FROM, type the following and answer yes to all questions:<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">ssh-keygen -t dsa</span><br /><br />Do not try to copy and paste the public key manually! Though it's a string sometimes strange things will happen to certain characters when you copy-paste it via the terminal. Instead, use ssh-copy-id. Type the following and enter the password:<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub root@activision1</span><br /><br />Now, SSH into the target server. If you are not prompted with a password then everything is working correctly.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">ssh root@activision1</span><br /><br />Make sure that the .ssh directory and everything in it is chmodded 600, otherwise anyone can edit it.<br /><br /><br />You can try looking at the logs in /var/log/messages or /var/log/secure or var/log/auth<br /><br />To pass commands to ssh remotely, do this:<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">ssh login@ip command_you_want</span><br /><br />example:<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">ssh root@linuxdev3 ls -l</span>
