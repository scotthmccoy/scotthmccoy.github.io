# Compared to Kotlin
* ARC
* Value types can implement protocols (POP)

# Compared to Java
* Type inference
* No raw types
* Closures are value types

# Compared to ObjC
* Strongly typed
* Optionals
* Generics
* Implicit conformance to protocols like Codable and Equatable
* Encourages functional programming
* Much more "ergonomic"
