You rank your choice of candidates like so:<br /><br />Winston Noble<br />Sid Gotama<br />Hubert Hoag<br /><br /><br />It gets (programatically) converted into a matrix of pairwise victories. Winston beats Sid and Hubert, so a 1 goes into both columns for "X11". Sid loses to Winston but beats Hubert, so he get "0X1". Hubert loses to both so he gets "00X".<br /><br /><pre><br />  WSH<br />W|X11<br />S|0X1<br />H|00X<br /></pre><br /><br />For all voters, simply add up the matrices. The winner is the candidate who does the best in each of their pairings.
