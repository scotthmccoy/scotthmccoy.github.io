[This Article](https://proandroiddev.com/realistic-realm-1-5-year-of-experience-cef75c8b164e) says that Realm is NoSQL like Mongo. It takes an offline-first approach such that you are primarily interacting with the cached results of API queries. It still has the old issue of DB objects being strongly tied to a particular thread such that you have to halt the main thread (Still? After all this time??) to fetch stuff from the local database just like CoreData used to do back when I was at HauteLook in 2011-2012. Also it took Realm until almost 2018 to be able to do proper diffs of lists of database objects!

Since the article was written in late 2017, that puts it a few months before the time I was last interviewing at Spokeo, Atom and Tinder in ~Feb 2018. Since the article talks about their use of Realm over the past 1.5 years it means they started using it in early-2015, or right when I was interviewing at OpenX. I think this means that Realm was a reaction to exactly the kinds of Core Data Hell we were going through at HauteLook in 2012.
