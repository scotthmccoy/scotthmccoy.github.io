It's happened to everyone - a task that seemed simple, measurable, and completable in a single sprint has Gone Wrong. Perhaps it turned out to have been based on faulty assumptions. Perhaps business goals have shifted and it's no longer doable. What do we do with the ticket? For velocity to be a useful metric, it has to capture estimation mistakes like this, but there's good arguments on both sides for what to do with it:

# Move it to Done
The team is a bit happier that they don't "lose points", but the Definition of Done becomes fuzzy by expanding it to include "Stuff that is technically _not_ done, but was abandoned for a good reason".

# Archive It
The project commitment drops by a small amount so we're still a few points closer to the project's finish line. The definition of Velocity maintains its integrity as an overall measurement of the average number of SPs per sprint that are successfully completed, counting estimation learning experiences like this one. The team typically feels a bit cheated that velocity has dropped, though.

There is, however, a third way:

# Slice It
Play King Solomon and split the ticket into the completed portion, which is now "Do Research" and the impossible portion, which is now "Implement Impossible Plan". Move the completed portion to Done and archive the impossible portion. The team is happy that they get some credit and velocity maintains integrity as a metric of work successfully completed per sprint.
