Select the layer you want to colorize, such as a brain or a raster font or whatever. Near the Layer Lock button, there's a button called "Preserve Transparency" or "Lock Transparent Pixels", click it, select a color, grab a bigass brush and paint away on top of the black and white image.<br /><br />HOLYCRAP!!
