# Files, Directories, Packages, Bundles and Frameworks:
A `package` is any directory that the Finder presents to the user as if it were a single file.
Finder considers a directory to be a package if **any** of the following conditions are true:
1. The directory has a known filename extension: .app, .bundle, .framework, .plugin, .kext, and so on.
2. The directory has an extension that some other application claims represents a package type; see Document Packages.
3. The directory has its package bit set.
A `bundle` is type of `package` with a standardized hierarchical structure that holds executable code and the resources used by that code. Apps and `frameworks` are examples of `bundles`.


# Libraries vs Frameworks
* A `Library` is a collection of `object files` which are compiled .m files outputed by Clang as a .o file. (Author's note: presumably .swift files are compiled into .o files as well, but I haven't checked.) Like gcc, Clang is a compiler for the c-family of languages and is backed by the LLVM compiler infrastructure which stands for "Low Level Virtual Machine" despite it [not being a Virtual Machine](https://llvm.org/). `Object files` contain symbols for the linker to piece together into a `Mach-O Object File` (see below).  
* A `Framework` is a type of `bundle` containing a static or dynamic `library` and its resources.
* So, a `Framework` is a `bundle` (which is also a `package`) that contains a `library` which is a collection of `object files`.



# Mach-O Object Files & Types
Distinct from an `object file` generated by clang, these `Macho-O Object Files` are the various [options for output from Xcode's linker phase](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/MachOTopics/1-Articles/building_files.html) under Build Settings -> Linking -> Mach-O type. The most significant to this writing are `Static Library` and `Dynamic Library`, which inform how a Library or Framework may be linked by its consumer:

# Static vs Dynamic

| | Static  | Dynamic |
|-|---------|---------|
| Library   | ![]({{site.url}}/images/static_library.png) A **.a** file linked by the Static Linker at compile time. Must be shipped with header files. | ![]({{site.url}}/images/dynamic_library.png) A **.dylib** file linked by the Dynamic Linker, or  `dyld` as-needed at runtime. The advantage is that libraries can be shared and don't take up space in each app. For example, all iOS and macOS system libraries are dynamic. The disadvantage is a slower launch/run time since the linking phase must occur during runtime. |
| Framework | ![]({{site.url}}/images/static_framework.png) A `package` with the **.framework** extension containing a Static Library and its headers and other resources. Linked at compile time. | ![]({{site.url}}/images/dynamic_framework.png) A `package` with the **.framework** extension containing a Dynamic Library and its headers and other resources. These must either be made available by the operating system (As all iOS and MacOS libraries/frameworks are) or be `embedded` into the App's bundle. |

# Potential Gains from switching to From Dynamic to Static Libs/Frameworks
In an example using 27 frameworks, [this dev](https://medium.com/@acecilia/static-vs-dynamic-frameworks-in-swift-an-in-depth-analysis-ff61a77eec65):
1. **Reduced app size 14.55%**. They theorized this was due to the compiler being able to remove unused symbols which is not possible when using dynamic frameworks, and linked this [heated exchange](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift/pull/1960) for reference. 
2. **Reduced first-launch load time by about 37.5%**. Subsequent launches were comparable thanks to the dyld cache.

Though the first-launch speed gains are worth pursuing, the size gains should only affect Swift libraries/frameworks since an Objective-C static library aught to be passed to the linker with the -ObjC option specified which "Loads all members of static archive libraries that implement an Objective-C class or category" since one of ObjC's strengths/weaknesses is that it loads the entire symbol table and you can send any message to any object.

From [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2567498/objective-c-categories-in-static-library](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2567498/objective-c-categories-in-static-library)
> To resolve this issue, the static library should pass the -ObjC option to the linker. This flag causes the linker to load every object file in the library that defines an Objective-C class or category. While this option will typically result in a larger executable (due to additional object code loaded into the application), it will allow the successful creation of effective Objective-C static libraries that contain categories on existing classes.

# Static vs Dynamic Frameworks and Swift
* It used to be the case that a framework that used Swift **had to** be dynamic, probably because the Swift libraries must be included in the framework package because of Swifts ABI instability prior to 5.0, and the fact that because they were system libraries, they were distributed as dylibs. 
* ABI Stability came in March of 2019 with Swift 5. This allowed the App Store to [thin app downloads](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/swift-5-release-notes-for-xcode-10_2) of their Swift dylibs so long as the device is running iOS 12.2 or higher (and thus came with the Swift dylibs already installed). For prior iOS versions, the Swift dylibs would still have to be included in the app and downloaded by the user.
* Module Stability came in September of 2019 with Swift 5.1. This allowed true [backwards compatibility](https://www.donnywals.com/what-is-module-stability-in-swift-and-why-should-you-care/) with prior versions of Swift (at the time, only 5.0 and 5.0.1):
> While ABI Stability allows programs written with different versions of Swift to exist in a shared runtime, Module Stability allows you to use frameworks compiled with different versions of Swift in a project that might use yet another version of Swift.
* You can now make a Swift static library. This [article](https://medium.com/onfido-tech/distributing-compiled-ios-swift-static-libraries-and-swift-static-frameworks-7fecc4f3d182) gives pretty detailed instructions, including what to do with the .swiftmodule. 

# Swift in a Framework Still Not a Good Idea 
And it probably won't be until most major apps are on Swift 5.1+ and/or until iOS 12.1 dies.

If the framework uses Swift 5.1+, the host app uses Swift 5.1+, and the app targets iOS 12.2 or higher, you're golden. But, big apps tend to target very low iOS versions so a framework has to target 12.1 and lower (and thus include the Swift dylibs) to be of any real value to the world. Users on 12.1 and lower then have to download them, potentially twice if the framework and app have differing Swift versions (which may not even be compatible with each other if one of those is prior to 5.1). It's possible that app thinning doesn't extend to removing redundant versions of the same dylibs in which case the user would have to download them twice even if the Swift versions matched. This seems to be somewhat implied by "Apps using bundled runtimes will however not get the benefits of App Store app thinning" on [this page](https://swift.org/blog/abi-stability-and-apple/). 

So, we're effectively in the same boat we were in back in 2017/2018: Using swift in a framework has the potential for incompatibility with the host app and may increase download sizes by about 5 megs.  

Assuming that 1 major version of iOS is dropped from general support per year and iOS 9 finally getting killed off this year (2020), 12.1 may not be killed until 2022 or 2023 at which point we can finally write a framework in Swift and be able to guarantee that it won't cause any problems for a major publisher. It's likely that prior to that enough major publishers will adopt Swift 5.1+ that the balance shifts and it becomes the rule rather than the exception that a framework will be written in Swift, but I don't think we're there yet.


# Modulemaps
When do you need one and why? I'm pretty sure you only need one for Swift-based frameworks?


# TODO
1. Why did libraries containing a mix of Swift and ObjC NEED a modulemap? 

# Other Terms
* *Umbrella Framework* - a framework that contains other frameworks. It is [possible but not officially supported on iOS](https://medium.com/@andreamiotz/ios-umbrella-framework-with-cocoapods-57d2d3c2daa9). Normally, when you create a framework which has a dependency, the app is responsible for adding that dependency along with your framework into the project. 
* *Modular Framework* - a framework which contains a .modulemap file inside. Modules can contains submodules. The main advantage is that you save a build time with Modular Framework. Note

# #import versus @import
* In 2013, Xcode 5 added "Enable Modules" under Build Settings -> Apple Clang - Language - Modules. This is set to Yes by default. Also known as or "Semantic Import", it maps all `#import` and `#include` to use `@import` instead. If clang can find a modulemap with with the same name,  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18947516/import-vs-import-ios-7

# Real versus Fake Frameworks
You can safely skip this section as this distinction is no longer of any real significance, Xcode having fixed this bug(?) in 2014 with the release of Xcode 6. 

In disallowing dynamically linked libraries for iOS Apple accidentally(?) removed static iOS framework creation functionality. Developers responded with the "relocatable object file" bundle hack, which tricked Xcode into building something that mostly resembles a framework, but is really a bundle. Alternately, with some tweaking of Xcode itself you could add the ability to create a static iOS framework back into Xcode using this plugin: [iOS-Universal-Framework](https://github.com/kstenerud/iOS-Universal-Framework).

# How do you handle code signing?
TODO: add to this section

Embedding dylibs now works (checked with Xcode Version 10.2). Targets -> Frameworks, Libraries and Embedded content.
see https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/11.0/index.html?localePath=en.lproj#/dev51a648b07
Very good news, because the approach using a build phase has a big problem: code signing happens after all phases ran. So, before that new setting was introduced it could happen that you copied unsigned versions of your libs to the app bundle, which failed the application build, because the app could not be signed.
