I'm trying to consolidate my thoughts on [Robert Cecil Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin), better known as Uncle Bob.

He's undeniably had a tremendous impact on programming, having codified [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) in 2000, was a signatory for the [Agile Manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) in 2001, and published [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) in 2008, and also been a huge proponent of [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) - basically all the things that I am a bit zeleous about as a programmer.

He's also said a lot of things ranging from myopically dated to actually hateful:

I'll add more things as I find them; this is not meant to be an exhaustive list. I'm told that he's also said that women shouldn't be in programming and equated femininity with weakness but I couldn't find any evidence of that. Several folks pointed towards a twitter thread that seems to have been scrubbed. Suffice it to say I was curious why some of my colleages would hate the guy and I found sufficient evidence to inform that being a reasonable opinion.

Granted, a lot of this is probably owing at least partially to the fact that he was born in 1951 and therefor 72 at the time of this writing, but it doesn't make it any less excusable.

> I don't think there's a single reason- a lot of people have independently written him off for a lot of different reasons. I'd say you can group the complaints broadly into 4 categories:
>
> People think that his books are over-rated
>
> People disagree with his technical opinions generally
>
> People disagree with his views on leadership and team dynamics
>
> People disagree with his social views and don't want to be associated with them by recommending him.
>
> To address these one-by-one:
> 
> First: He's written several books. Clean Code is the most well known. Most of these books are full of a mix of common sense that you could learn anywhere, bad advice that nobody should learn, and things that made sense in a very particular sort of corporate culture in the late 90's and early 2000's but are no longer relevant. His writing style is fine, it'll seem persuasive to someone who has never read that style of writing before, and the books are mostly read by people who are too inexperienced to recognize that they aren't that good. More experienced people are frustrated by this.
> 
> Second: People tend to disagree with his general technical opinions. He's a TDD and pair programming zealot, and those are decisive opinions, so he was always going to lose some people there. He's also very much still steeped in the early 2000's everything-is-an-object OOP mindset, and has written extensively about disliking both static type systems (which he seems to think compete with testing for some reason) and functional programming at a time when they are getting much more popular.
> 
> Third: This is a partial restatement of the last point, but generally I'd say it's fair to say that he's not actually a developer these days. His real job is being an Agile consultant, and he advocates for a particular flavor of agile process that removes a lot of agency from individual engineers. His approach to running software teams turns every team into a feature factory where engineers are fungible and nobody does deep work or has real ownership. Most people find this kind of environment soul sucking.
> 
> Fourth: He's said some stuff on his blogs and on twitter that are either directly racist or misogynistic, or indirectly supportive of other people who have said racist or misogynistic things. I don't know the details, I stopped following or caring about him long before that happened because of all of the technical reasons. In any rate, most people these days seem to see talking about him much as a signal that you agree with his stance on those things, and so people who don't agree with that stance are distancing themselves from him. That said, I think most of the industry realize that his books are still regularly suggested to people who don't know much about him, and so I think it carries as much weight as people assume socially.
