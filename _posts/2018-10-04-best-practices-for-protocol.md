Obj-C has a quirky rule: <b>You can't forward declare a superclass or a protocol it conforms to.</b> This rule usually isn't an issue until it ends up being a requirement to do something like put a protocol in its own file such that it can be imported in multiple places, but doing so suddenly prompts an unwinding of circular-import spaghetti where classes that have been importing each other to get access to the things that those classes imported need to be tidied up.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>As such, it's generally a good idea to follow the following rules which cost a little bit of effort up front but can save a lot of time doing this sort of cleanup all at once down the line:&nbsp;<div><ol><li>In classes's header files, only import the superclassâ€™s .h and @Class everything else.</li><li>Protocols go in their own .h file. Don't ever forward-declare protocols, just import the .h file.</li><li>As long as you're following rule <a href="https://github.corp.openx.com/mobile/ios-sdk/pull/1">#1</a>, rule <a href="https://github.corp.openx.com/mobile/ios-sdk/pull/2">#2</a> is not as important.</li></ol></div></div>
