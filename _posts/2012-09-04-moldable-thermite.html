Play Doh was .3 ounces per teaspoon, thermite was .1 ounces.<br /><br />The recipe called for 4 parts thermite to 1 part Play Doh. I couldn't get the stuff to knead together, and each attempt ended up with a flakey mess that I could stab with a sparkler, but would refuse to ignite when the sparkler burned through it.<br /><br />So, I added water to the mix and mixed it thoroughly, (probably staining a plastic bowl in the process). I then shaped it into a cookie and baked it on Broil (over 350 degrees) - a lower temperature for longer would probably have worked better.<br /><br />Thankfully it didn't stick to the baking sheet at all and the result was as hard as greenware clay.  Placing the "cookie" in a small pile of thermite and igniting the pile worked in a test run, and again with the Man at the beach.<br /><br />Sadly I forgot to light it with the laser, and the wind made it very difficult to ignite with a lighter. Turning the lighter up to max and making sure the yellow part of the flame touched the tip of the sparkler helped.<br /><br />Things to try:<br />1. Repeat the experiment as closely as possible, but record the amount of play-doh, thermite, cooking time, baking sheet, etc. And make a proper recipe.<br />2. Try a lower temperature bake to see if it can remain in a soft clay-like state.
