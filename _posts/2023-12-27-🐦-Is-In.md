/*
 Swift lacks an "is contained by", which makes state checks a bit ungainly to write/read.
 The isIn function aims to help with that. For example, the following:

 let systemSchemes = ["tel", "mailto", "sms", "itms"]
 return systemSchemes.contains(urlScheme)

 Is equivalent to:
 
 return urlScheme.isIn(["tel", "mailto", "sms", "itms"])
*/

extension Equatable {
    func isIn (_ rhs: any Collection<Self>) -> Bool {
        rhs.contains(self)
    }
}
```
