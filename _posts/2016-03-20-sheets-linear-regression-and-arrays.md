<b>=TREND(B2:B8,A2:A8,A9:A15)</b><br /><br />TREND is pretty sweet. It does Linear Regression. Give it a range of y-vals, a range of x-vals and a range of future vals and it'll write in all the future values.<br /><br /><br /><b>=CONCATENATE(ROW(),","COLUMN())</b><br />Great way to make matrices.<br /><b><br /></b><b>=INDEX(LINEST(B2:B8, A2:A8, 1, 1),1,1)</b><br />LINEST gives you some cool stats, but it comes in a 2-D array for some dumb reason. INDEX lets you fetch values out! This example gets the second row, second column back.
