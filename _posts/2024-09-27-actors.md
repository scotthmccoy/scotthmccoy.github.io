# What are Actors Good at?

They completely prevent **data races** (a type of race condition where one thread accesses a mutable object while another thread writes to it, crashing your app with EXC_BAD_ACCESS) and they do so simply and elegantly. Note that they don't prevent all type of **race condition** (the order/timing in which you do stuff affecting the outcome). You typically need to very carefully manage a task pool on all but the most simplistic of actors to prevent other types of race conditions.


# What New Functionality do Actors Provide?

Actors are the source of swift's isolation model, which is "Rentrant compile time isolation". The goal of this model seems to be to:

- Eliminate data races
- Move "what thread am I on" issues from a runtime puzzle to a compile-time certainty. For example, you never need to check `Thread.isMainThread` anymore, you can just mark a func as `@MainActor`:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f95a7b08-b17f-423e-9606-a1b0b61e04b5)
- Given that it's reentrant, it seems to have chosen the evils of race conditions over deadlock, declaring that a weirdly behaving app is better than a completely frozen one.
 
Isolation comes in 3 flavors:

- Static: The main func is automatically isolated to MainActor. Inside of a user-defined Actor's funcs/vars, the compiler synthesizes all the data race prevention and thread serialization boilerplate you would have had to write using `DispatchQueue`'s, `Semaphore`s and so forth. In addition to being automatically serialized, **the compiler treats it as an error if you try to break isolation boundaries**, which prevents you from being able to write code with data races. 

- Dynamic: Despite the name, this is still specified at compile time. You make a potentially risky promise that you'll be isolated to a particular Actor, typically from a nonisolated context, such as with `MainActor.assumeIsolated {...}`. This seems to be useful for wrapping code that was written without concurrency in mind.
  
- None: It's up to you to make sure that there are no data races. You can opt into this using `@nonisolated`. You can also use `Task.detached`, though there's typically never a reason to want to use that over a regular Task or maybe even a TaskGroup, both of which inherit the isolation of their calling contexts.

Note that because isolation occurs at _compile time_, user-defined actors don't really provide any run-time benefit. You _could_ do implement your own version of isolation with the classic `final class` implementing some funcs that wrap `DispatchQueue.sync` or `DispatchQueue.async` calls, but that work is error-prone and boring.

# The Evolution Towards Actors

First we start with a simple data store which has the potential for a data race if `user()` and `store()` are called at the same time by different threads:

```
class UserStorage {
    private var users = [User.ID: User]()

    func store(_ user: User) {
        users[user.id] = user
    }

    func user(withID id: User.ID) -> User? {
        users[id]
    }
}
```

The usual fix for this is to wrap everything in DispatchQueue.sync blocks, but this means that we risk "data contention", or a bunch of threads waiting for access. If a thousand interactions are queued up and there's any lag on the `users` var (maybe instead of a dict it's actually reading to/writing from a sqlite db or something), then your app can really start to chug waiting for all the syncs to resolve:

```
class UserStorage {
    private var users = [User.ID: User]()
    private let queue = DispatchQueue(label: "UserStorage.sync")

    func store(_ user: User) {
        queue.sync {
            self.users[user.id] = user
        }
    }

    func user(withID id: User.ID) -> User? {
        queue.sync {
            self.users[id]
        }
    }
}
```

So you use DispatchQueue.async instead, but that means having to use completionHandlers, which can get akward fast especially if they have to nest.
```
class UserStorage {
    private var users = [User.ID: User]()
    private let queue = DispatchQueue(label: "UserStorage.sync")

    func store(_ user: User) {
        queue.async {
            self.users[user.id] = user
        }
    }

    func loadUser(
      withID id: User.ID,
      handler: @escaping (User?) -> Void
    ) {
        queue.async {
          handler(self.users[id])
        }
    }
}
```

An actor automatically serializes all access to its properties and methods, which ensures that only one caller can directly interact with the actor at any given time. That in turn gives us complete protection against data races, since all mutations will be performed serially, one after the other. **Note that the funcs do not have to be async.**

```
actor UserStorage {
    private var users = [User.ID: User]()

    func store(_ user: User) {
        users[user.id] = user
    }

    func user(withID id: User.ID) -> User? {
        users[id]
    }
}
```



# Reentrancy

Reentrancy is a programming concept where a function or subroutine can be interrupted and then resumed before it finishes executing. This means that the function can be called again before it completes its previous execution.

**Actor-isolated async functions are reentrant**. When an actor-isolated async function suspends, reentrancy allows other work to execute on the actor before the original actor-isolated function resumes, which we refer to as interleaving. In the following example, a second call to `doStuff()` starts running while the first one is awaiting `Task.sleep`:

```
import Foundation

actor MyActor {
    
    var lastUser = ""
    
    func doStuff(_ name: String) async {
        print("\(name), \(Date())")
        lastUser = name
        try! await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 1000000000)
        print("\(name) End, lastUser = \(lastUser), \(Date())")
    }
}

let myActor = MyActor()
Task {
    await myActor.doStuff("Alice")
}

Task {
    await myActor.doStuff("Bob")
}
```
Output:
```
Alice, 2024-10-08 01:26:21 +0000
Bob, 2024-10-08 01:26:21 +0000
Bob End, lastUser = Bob, 2024-10-08 01:26:22 +0000
Alice End, lastUser = Bob, 2024-10-08 01:26:22 +0000
```

This might be confusing or frustrating, since on the surface it seems like actors fail even the most the basic "ATM Overdraw" test. Thankfully, the solution is pretty easy: implement a Task pool:

```
actor UserLoader {
    private let storage: UserStorage
    private let urlSession: URLSession
    private let decoder = JSONDecoder()
    private var activeTasks = [User.ID: Task<User, Error>]()

    ...

    func loadUser(withID id: User.ID) async throws -> User {
        if let existingTask = activeTasks[id] {
            return try await existingTask.value
        }

        let task = Task<User, Error> {
            if let storedUser = await storage.user(withID: id) {
                activeTasks[id] = nil
                return storedUser
            }
        
            let url = URL.forLoadingUser(withID: id)
            
            do {
                let (data, _) = try await urlSession.data(from: url)
                let user = try decoder.decode(User.self, from: data)

                await storage.store(user)
                activeTasks[id] = nil
                return user
            } catch {
                activeTasks[id] = nil
                throw error
            }
        }

        activeTasks[id] = task

return try await task.value
    }
}
```
